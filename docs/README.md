## 🎯 Production Recommendations

1. **Use both models** (ML + Statistical) for redundancy
2. **Monitor rate-of-change** indicators for early warning
3. **Review predictions daily** during high-risk periods
4. **Validate against market conditions** and news
5. **Use bottom predictions** for optimal re-entry timing
